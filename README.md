  - CSS `clamp()` for fluid scaling.

- **Responsive Images and Videos**
  - Responsive image techniques with `srcset` and `picture` tags.
  - Maintaining aspect ratios with `aspect-ratio` and `object-fit` for media.

## 6. Animations and Transitions

- **CSS Transitions**

  - Transition properties: `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, `transition-delay`.
  - Applying transitions for hover effects and element states.

- **CSS Animations**

  - Keyframes: defining animation stages with `@keyframes`.
  - Animation properties: `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, `animation-iteration-count`.
  - Practical animation examples.

- **Transforms and 3D Animations**
  - 2D transformations: scale, rotate, translate, skew.
  - Using perspective for 3D effects.
  - Combining transitions and transforms for smoother animations.

## 7. Advanced CSS Techniques

- **CSS Variables (Custom Properties)**

  - Defining and reusing CSS variables.
  - Practical use cases for theme management and reusable styles.

- **Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements in Depth**

  - Using pseudo-classes like hover, focus, active, and visited for interactivity.
  - Styling content with pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after.

- **CSS Shapes and Clipping**
  - Creating shapes with CSS (triangles, circles, polygons).
  - Using `clip-path` and `shape-outside` for creative layout designs.

## 8. CSS Architecture and Scalable CSS

- **CSS Methodologies**

  - BEM (Block Element Modifier): Naming conventions for maintainable CSS.
  - SMACSS and OOCSS principles for modular, scalable styling.

- **Utility-First CSS (Atomic CSS)**

  - Atomic CSS approach: small utility classes.
  - Tailwind CSS overview and utility class management.
